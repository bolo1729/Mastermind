Mastermind
==========

Basic analysis for the Mastermind game: solving codes and finding
best moves.  This is a toy project of mine, through which I'm
learning both how to write better code in Haskell and how to 
distribute software written in Haskell.  Code reviews and suggestions
are welcome -- please use pull requests for that purpose.
